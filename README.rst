Current status
--------------

There is a `/predict` endpoint! It works! We tested with a few different images, all SFW because we're in a coworking space and don't want people to think bad things about us...
Preliminary results: cats are safer than dogs xD

Next up: implement a /results endpoint for the client to retrieve the results.
